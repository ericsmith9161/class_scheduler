# Class Scheduler Application

**Problem:** There is a strong demand from immigrants for naturalization classes
in NYC. There is also a large supply of volunteers offering to teach such
classes. The bottleneck is that connecting immigrants and volunteers is done
manually by non-profit staff, who do not have the capacity to provide
matching/scheduling services.

**Purpose:** Build a Rails app that lets clients schedule naturalization classes with
volunteers.
