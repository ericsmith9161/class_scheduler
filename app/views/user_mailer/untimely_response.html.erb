<h1>Dear <%= @volunteer.first_name %>,</h1>
<p>
  You have received a client message from <%= @client.first_name %> for help with <%= @program.name %>. Unfortunately, you have not responded within 48 hours as requested by Tutoria when you agreed to be a volunteer.
</p>

<p>
  As a result, we have deactivated your availabilities and you will no longer receive further client messages. You can still respond to <%= @client.first_name %>'s message. If you do so you will be able to reactivate your availabilities by following these steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Sign in to Tutoria </li>
  <br>
  <li> Reactivate availabilities by going to <a href='https://tutoria.io/en/availabilities'>Availabilities page</a>.</li>
  <br>
  <li> On the availabilities page, click the "Reactivate button to reactivate your availabilities" </li>
</ol>
<p>
  If you have any questions, please email <a href='mailto:community.manager@tutoria.io'>community.manager@tutoria.io</a> or contact +1(929)359-3986 by phone or WhatsApp
</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
