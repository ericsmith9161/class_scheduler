Dear <%= @volunteer.first_name %>,
===============================================
You have received a client message from <%= @client.first_name %> for help with <%= @program.name %> Unfortunately, you have not responded within 48 hours as requested by Tutoria when you agreed to be a volunteer.

As a result, we have deactivated your availabilities and you will no longer receive further client messages. You can still respond to <%= @client.first_name %>'s message. If you do so you will be able to reactivate your availabilities by following these steps:

  1. Sign in to Tutoria
  2. Reactivate availabilities by going to Availabiilities page.
  3. On the availabilities page, click the "Reactivate button to reactivate your availabilities"

If you have any questions, please email community.manager@tutoria.io or contact +1(929)359-3986 by phone or WhatsApp

Thank you,


Team Tutor√≠a
